Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like templates for how to solve problems that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are divided into three main categories:

1.Creational Patterns

Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance.

Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.

Builder: Constructs complex objects step by step.

2.Structural Patterns


Adapter: Makes incompatible interfaces work together.

Composite: Composes objects into tree structures.

Facade: Simplifies a complex system interface.


3.Behavioral Patterns


Observer: Notifies multiple objects of state changes.

Strategy: Allows switching between algorithms dynamically.

Command: Encapsulates requests as objects for flexibility.


These patterns improve code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.
